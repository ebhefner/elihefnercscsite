This is one of the most popular attractions in all of North Carolina. The Biltmore Estate is located on a gorgeous 8,000 acres of land containing various gardens containing stunning pools and statues. Other things found on the grounds include the first managed forest in the States, a plethora of different pathways, and a deer park. Most notable however is the Vanderbilt Mansion, located right in the heart of the compound. Holding the title of the biggest private home in the United States, all 250 rooms are filled with first-rate antiques, art, and clothing. All are housed in the awe-inspiring architecture of the Mansion.
