<p>
The Blue Ridge Parkway is a 469-mile parkway that goes from the Great Smoky Mountains to the Shenandoah National Park. It was designed by Stanely Abbott, a landscape architect who had the vision to create a road that was more than getting from point A to B. The parkway is designed to accentuate the natural beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the landscape it traverses. The parkway has no shortage of activities either, with numerous hiking trails, campgrounds, bike trails, and picnic spots spread along the drive. Just as a word of warning, however, from November to March inclement weather often causes various road closures.
